5. ‚úÖ Check **"Add to PATH"** during installation

### Step 2: Install Android SDK Command Line Tools

2. Extract to: `C:\Android\cmdline-tools`
3. Open PowerShell as Administrator:
   ```powershell
   cd C:\Android\cmdline-tools\bin
   .\sdkmanager.bat "platform-tools" "platforms;android-34" "build-tools;34.0.0"
   ```

### Step 3: Set Environment Variables
Open PowerShell as Administrator:
```powershell
[System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('ANDROID_HOME', 'C:\Android', 'User')

### Option A: GitHub Actions (Free)
