## 🚀 **Quick Commands (Alternative Method)**

If you prefer using command line with Git:

### Install Git (if not installed):
Download from: https://git-scm.com/download/win

### Upload to GitHub:
```bash
cd C:\Users\safeer.mumraiz\Desktop\TV-REMOTE-APP

# Initialize Git (if not already done)
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Commit
git commit -m "Initial commit - TV Remote App"

# Connect to GitHub (replace YOUR-USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/TV-Remote-App.git

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

After pushing, GitHub Actions will automatically build your APK!

## 📦 **What Happens During Build?**

The GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/build-apk.yml`) does this:

1. ✅ Sets up Java JDK 17
2. ✅ Downloads Android SDK and build tools
3. ✅ Downloads project dependencies
4. ✅ Builds the APK
5. ✅ Uploads APK as downloadable artifact

**All of this happens on GitHub's servers - not your computer!**

1. Make your code changes locally
2. Go to your GitHub repository
3. Click **"Add file"** → **"Upload files"**
4. Upload the changed files (or all files again)

## 💡 **Tips**

- **First build takes 4-5 minutes** (downloads dependencies)
- **Subsequent builds are faster** (2-3 minutes)
- **Check Actions tab** to see build progress
- **APKs expire after 30 days** (just rebuild if needed)
- **Free tier allows** 2000 build minutes per month (more than enough!)

## 🛠️ **Troubleshooting**

### Build fails:
- Check the **"Actions"** tab for error details
- Most common: Incorrect file structure
- Make sure all files are in correct folders

### Can't enable Actions:
